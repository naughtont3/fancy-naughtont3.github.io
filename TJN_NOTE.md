TJN NOTE
--------
 - 24nov2024: Started doing the customization.  This may be more than I care
   to manage.  Note, I started to create a "Create New Blog" action that you
   could manually run and fill in a blog post to commit/post to the blog.
   The initial version worked ok, but I got more clever to try and
   auto-populate the categories and tags using the short custom plugin code
   under `_plugins/local-extract-categories-tags.rb` that is used with
   `.github/workflows/new-post.yml`.

 - 24nov2024: I have renamed repo to 'fancy-naughtont3.github.io', and
   disabled Actions (`Settings -> Actions -> General -> Disable actions`)
   (previously was `Allow all actions and reusable workflows`).
   To re-enable, rename to `naughtont3.github.io`, reenable Actions.
