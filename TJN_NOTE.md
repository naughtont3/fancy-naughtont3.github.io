TJN NOTE
--------
 - 24nov2024: Started doing the customization.  This may be more than I care
   to manage.  I have renamed repo to 'fancy-naughtont3.github.io', and
   disabled Actions (`Settings -> Actions -> General -> Disable actions`)
   (previously was `Allow all actions and reusable workflows`).
   To re-enable, rename to `naughtont3.github.io`, reenable Actions.
